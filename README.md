... App Idea Brainstorming ...

Nowadays, the issue of access to clean water has become a concerning matter. Thus, I would like to develop an app that assists in locating water distribution centers and provides complete information on water distillation. The app will feature a virtual payment system to ensure a smooth billing process. Additionally, it will include a virtual meter that reports the consumer's water level and suggests a new supply when needed. Moreover, the app will have a sharing water section that allows consumers to share their subscriptions with family members or have multiple consumption points.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The difficulties I encountered relate to optional features. Initially, I struggled to implement two ViewControllers and related them. I also struggled with rounding the corners of my profile picture. However, with the help of tutorials on YouTube, I learned how to implement those features. On the other hand, I had difficulty implementing a way to change the font color to a random color. I believe that the skills I will gain in this course will allow me to develop a solution for the difficulty of changing randomizer fonts.
